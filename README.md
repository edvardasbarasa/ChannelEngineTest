# ChannelEngineTest

The project is completed, works and fulfills the requirements of the test task. Howether three hours is not enough for me to get this project to production ready state.

Things that can be improved or added : 
* Logging;
* Exception handling;
* Bad result processing;
* Cache decorator (Retry decorator may be not enough to secure smooth work because of the external service polling that is dictated by the test requerements. But taking out all orders from external service to pick top 5 products is really controversial idea. );
* More tests for ChannelEngineExternalService;
* Frontend page to web part;
* Refactoring;
* Comments;
